## üìä What is Things?  

**Things** is a modern task management app built to help users capture ideas, plan work, and ship projects with less friction. It blends a minimalist interface with powerful organization features so you can focus on getting things done rather than fighting the app.

At its core, Things uses a hierarchy of **Inbox ‚Üí Today/Upcoming ‚Üí Projects & Areas** to mirror real-world workflows. Capture quick thoughts and tasks into the Inbox, triage them into projects or scheduled items, and use Today/Upcoming to focus on what matters next. This structure keeps short-term focus and long-term planning neatly separated while remaining flexible for different work styles.

The app emphasizes speed and ergonomics: natural keyboard shortcuts, quick entry windows, and smart date parsing let you add and schedule tasks in seconds. Projects support checklists, headings, and deadlines, turning large goals into manageable steps. Areas help you group related projects (e.g., Work, Personal, Travel) so context switching is cleaner and less stressful.

Things also includes thoughtful features for consistent productivity: a powerful search, tags for cross-cutting organization, repeating tasks for routines, and native macOS integration (Calendar, Reminders import, Handoff, and Shortcuts). Sync is handled securely and quietly via Things Cloud, keeping devices in sync without extra setup. For creatives and professionals, Things combines a calm UI with robust project tools ‚Äî ideal for single-user workflows that require both clarity and depth.

Practical ways people use Things:
- Daily planning: triage the Inbox each morning and fill Today with a focused, realistic list.  
- Project management: break large tasks into checklist steps and track progress with deadlines.  
- Contextual work: use tags (e.g., ‚Äúphone‚Äù, ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, ‚Äúerrand‚Äù) to filter tasks by context or energy level.  
- Routines & habits: set repeating tasks for morning routines, backups, or weekly reviews.  
- Reference & capture: store notes, links, and quick ideas in tasks so nothing slips through the cracks.

### ‚ú® Key Features:
- Clean minimal interface with powerful keyboard navigation.  
- Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Projects, and Areas for structured workflows.  
- Tags, headings, and checklists for detailed organization.
